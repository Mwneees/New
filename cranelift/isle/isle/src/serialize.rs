//! Put "sea of nodes" representation of a `RuleSet` into a sequential order.
//!
//! We're trying to satisfy two key constraints on generated code:
//!
//! First, we must produce the same result as if we tested the left-hand side
//! of every rule in descending priority order and picked the first match.
//! But that would mean a lot of duplicated work since many rules have similar
//! patterns. We want to evaluate in an order that gets the same answer but
//! does as little work as possible.
//!
//! Second, some ISLE patterns can only be implemented in Rust using a `match`
//! expression (or various choices of syntactic sugar). Others can only
//! be implemented as expressions, which can't be evaluated while matching
//! patterns in Rust. So we need to alternate between pattern matching and
//! expression evaluation.
//!
//! To meet both requirements, we repeatedly partition the set of rules for a
//! term and build a tree of Rust control-flow constructs corresponding to each
//! partition. The root of such a tree is a [Block].
