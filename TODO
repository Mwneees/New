- Constant propagation
- Provide extra info on load enodes indicating last store (alias info)
- all simple_preopt
- disable simple_preopt, GVN, LICM, then profile!

- perf ideas:
  - "early selection": one enode is preemptively selected. Others are
    kept around to steer dedup to the proper eclass, but only that one
    enode is returned by `(pure_enode ...)` (i.e., seen by simplify
    rules henceforth).
  - finer-grain dirty list: apply simplify only to certain enodes, not
    whole eclass.
  - "cut" operator: return immediately from a multi-ctor with only
    what we have.

- "fuel" / limiting expansion.

- cprop for floating-point
- strength reduction
- branch folding

- legalization
  - replace `op_imm` ops with `op` (legalization)
  - heap, table, ...
    - show dedup of parts of heap addr computation
  - i128 -> i64 narrowing?
