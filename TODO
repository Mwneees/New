- all simple_preopt

- cprop for floating-point
- strength reduction
- branch folding

- legalization
  - replace `op_imm` ops with `op` (legalization)
  - heap, table, ...
    - show dedup of parts of heap addr computation
  - i128 -> i64 narrowing?

- perf ideas
  - limit nodes exposed in pure_enodes_etor: pre-extract? "subsume"
    nodes/return from simplify?
  - make alias analysis faster to compute
    - visit_block_succs: cache successor list? or use
      ControlFlowGraph?
    - cache predicates? has_side_effect, is_memory_fence, ...
  - elaboration
    - find_best_node: stop at sufficiently cheap node? bound the
      search to better than what's found so far?
    - find_best_node: avoid scoped approach; compute best nodes
      independent of what's already available
  - keep Insts (side-effecting ops) in DFG, and just rewrite args and
    attach new results when elaborating.

- code quality ideas
  - extend "canonical" / "latest" to all args; allow for more merging
    this way
